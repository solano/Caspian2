This is (going to) be a simple multitask OS, developved in my spare time.
It may take a few years.

Dependencies:

- Cross versions of binutils and gcc targeted at i586-elf
- NASM

Optional:
- qemu
- GRUB (if you're not using qemu, which can boot without a bootloader, or
if you want to actually test this in a computer)
